                <ul>
                  <li>All work should be completed by one day before the deadline so the rest of the team has time to  review</li>

                    <ol>
                      <li>Work is either not complete by deadline, not related to the task at hand, or procedures were carried out incorrectly</li>

                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Prior to submitting any written work for this class, all members of the team should read through its full contents</li>
                  <li>Team members should keep detailed notes of team meetings, lab sessions, and class lectures</li>
                </ul>

                  <li>In order to include ideas from each team member, before each meeting every team member should list 1 or 2 ideas that they’ve come up (deadline is before the meeting starts)</li>
                  <li>In team meeting, each person will be assigned to be an informal leader for a certain task based on how comfortable they feel with that task</li>
                  <li>No task should be done by only one person</li>
                </ul>

                  <li>Team members are expected to complete assignments by deadline or give notice 3 days before a deadline so someone else can pick up the work (limit 2 times)</li>

                      <li>In the instance that all other members feel that a team member’s work has been of substandard quality over a substantial period of time, *their Cornell ID photo will be set as the background of our Homepage*</li>
                      <li>Continued infractions will result in repercussions on future team assessments, and team members will seek out intervention by course staff</li>
                    </ul>
