Group projects are hard. That's why we set these ground rules:

* ECE 3400, Semester #1	Team #27
* Team Members: Ria, Ben, Felicia, Ian, Michael

## Team Procedures
* Meetings will take place in UH142, Friday 11.15-12.05pm, weekly. In the future, more time may be conditionally allocated for these meetings

* Communication will occur primarily via Slack (https://ece3400team27.slack.com/)   

* Decisions will be made by consensus

* Lab leader for the period (ex Week 1-4) will be responsible for the agenda.
  * Agenda should be posted by the night before meeting ( i.e. Thursday night 11:59)
  * Team members should be notified via slack

* Lab leader for the following period (ex. Week 5-8) will keep records
  * Minutes and agendas will be in google drive folder shared with team members. 

* A point system will be used to keep the team on track during meeting
  * Members will lose 1 point each time they cause meeting to go off topic.  
  * If anyone goes 2 points or below for 2 meetings or more, their Cornell ID photo will be put on the website until they get above 3 points for a meeting. 

## Team Expectations
*Work Quality:*

* All work should be completed by one day before the deadline so the rest of the team has 
time to  review

* A 5 point system will be used by which other members will evaluate a member’s work. 
The rubric is as follows:
  1. Work is either not complete by deadline, not related to the task at hand, or procedures were carried out incorrectly 
  2. Work is complete but of substandard quality, limited details
  3. Work is okay
  4. Work is complete and documented well, done on time 
  5. Work is of exceptional quality, detailed and reproducible, done in a timely fashion

* Prior to submitting any written work for this class, all members of the team should read through its full contents

* Team members should keep detailed notes of team meetings, lab sessions, and class lectures

*Team Participation:*
	
* All team members understand their role in any given task
* The team leader should compile a list of tasks for each member to complete by lab deadline

* In order to include ideas from each team member, before each meeting every team member should list 1 or 2 ideas that they’ve come up (deadline is before the meeting starts)

* In team meeting, each person will be assigned to be an informal leader for a certain task based on how comfortable they feel with that task

* No task should be done by only one person

*Personal Accountability:*

* Team Members are expected to arrive at all meetings that have been scheduled and agreed upon for one week or more

* All work should be completed by one day before the deadline so the rest of the team can review

* Team members are expected to complete assignments by deadline or give notice 3 days before a deadline so someone else can pick up the work (limit 2 times)

* Team Members are expected to check for e-mail messages and Slack updates in a timely manner, and are encouraged to contribute frequently to discussions

* All team members are expected to contribute verbal input to each decision made by the team as a whole.

* Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations

  * In the case of smaller infractions, we will have an awkward group intervention to root out the problem and fix it

  * In the instance that all other members feel that a team member’s work has been of substandard quality over a substantial period of time, *their Cornell ID photo will be set as the background of our Homepage*

  * Continued infractions will result in repercussions on future team assessments, and team members will seek out intervention by course staff

*Team Leadership*

* Every person on the team will have to take the role as a leader. The role of the leader will be to organize meetings and make sure that everything is submitted in a timely manner. The leaders are assigned as below
  * Week 1-4 (Start-up, Lab 1, Milestone 1): Ria
  * Week 5-8 (Lab 2, Lab 3, Milestone 2): Ben
  * Week 9-12 (Lab 4, Milestone 3): Felicia
  * Week 13-16 (Milestone 4, competition, final report): Ian (comp) + Michael(report)
